  # This 'command' runs during the build process on Netlify's servers.
  # It uses a standard tool (sed) to find the placeholder text '%%API_KEY%%'
  # in your index.html file and replaces it with the actual secret API key
  # that you have stored as 'API_KEY' in your Netlify environment variables.
  # This process is secure and your key is never exposed in your public code.
